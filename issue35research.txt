//THIS IS A STASHING TEST

Git stash notes:

git stash //only stashes files that are tracked (git add)

found in VisGit:  
let stagedFileElements = document.getElementById('files-staged').children;

git stash -u //stashes all files including untracked

git stash apply //reinstate stashed changes ontop of current working tree (fails if conflicts)
git stash pop //applies and removed from stash list
[--index n] //option for which stash to operate on

- nodegit API seems to only support pop and apply
- graph/app must refresh after stash
- clear modified files list (like in addAndCommit)

code to write:
function addAndStash(){
	git.ts:126-182
	displayModal("stashing working directory...")
	addCommand("git stash")
	//Git.Stash.save or something
	updateModalText("Stash successful")
	refreshAll(repo)
}

GUI ideas:
	- must have files staged
	- have button next to commit in bottom left for stashing
	- have button in top bar for stashing (with options) and popping/applying (with options)
	- options can be drop down or pop up modal
